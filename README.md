## Contributing

Do you have an interesting example notebook that makes use of `ibis`? Please
consider submitting it to this repository.

Note that examples should adhere to the following guidelines:

- Run top-to-bottom without error/intervention from the user

- Not require external data sources that are likely to disappear over time

- Not be resource intensive. Currently notebook sessions launched in
  [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) have access to 1-2 GiB of RAM. Your
  example must be able to run within these restrictions.

- Be *interesting*, *exemplary* of good `ibis` usage, and of *general
  relevance* to `ibis` users.
